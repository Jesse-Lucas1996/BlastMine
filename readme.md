‚õèÔ∏è Mining Operations Dashboard

A lightweight web application simulating a mining operations monitoring system. Built with Vue.js and .NET Core, this project is inspired by the real-world needs of companies like Orica, who lead innovation in blasting, mining efficiency, and digital transformation.
üéØ Purpose

This project demonstrates how modern software tools can provide meaningful insights into mining operations. It simulates:

    Blast planning visualizations

    Ore movement tracking

    Equipment performance insights

    Safety zone mapping

By focusing on actionable data and real-time visualization, this dashboard concept aligns with Orica's mission to enable smarter and safer resource extraction.
